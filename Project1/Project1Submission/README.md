Hannah and I worked on this project together.
Hannah worked on the FileProcessor and helped with the LinkedList implementation. She also worked on the UML diagram.
I worked on the main bulk of the arithmetic functions such as add, multiply, and exponent.
Overall, we collaborated on parts we struggled with and worked together to overcome the problems and issues we came across.
