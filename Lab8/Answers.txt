6. We get the error because the method does not "Throw" an exception.
7. I am assuming extending RuntimeException allows it to compile and allow it to throw and it won't complain until the Runtime where it throws properly.
I think it is basically shifting the priority and allowing the runtime to deal with the Exception instead of the compiler. We also could have
added the Throw Exception in the method like I explained for #6
9.Circle only gets printed if it has a valid radius, which is any positive radius. In finally gets called right after either the Circle or the exception message.
Lastly Done gets printed after everything as it is outside the try/catch and none of the exceptions cause the program running to break.
14.  If I comment out the negative radius exception catch, it will not print message that I defined in the class NegativeRadiusException,
instead it will just create the crash stack report after the In Finally message. It will not continue onto "Done" since the program has stopped.
Furthermore, if I were to put the bad circle constructor before try, it will just send the crash report and will not continue to the try block.
